Now that we are integrating more technology into our lives, many people would require hardware like computers, laptops and other digital devices in order to survive in this changing world. Because of this, I plan on making this website about computer and laptop parts. The purpose is that many people of all ages may still be very inexperienced with laptops and choosing the correct one to what they want.

The website will showcase things such as information on the different computer parts such as the uses of the CPU, GPU, etc. The website will also showcase the best builds for different areas of what the pc would be used for (e.g Working/Gaming Pc) and contain a section on how the user can build their own pc (Via step by step and video) if they either buy their own parts from the recommended section (Since its cheaper) or just want to learn how to build one as it is a useful skill to have.



## Design Process
This website will be catered to those that are interested in learning more on the technology behind pc parts and their uses, Those seeking to learn skills that they can use in the future like building a pc or having more information on what specs (CPU,GPU etc.) collaborate well with each other. The website is also useful for those who want to see recommendations for different types of pc's correlating to different uses. This will ensure the user gets a birds eye view on what pc would best fit them.

**USER STORY 1** <br>
Mark recently had the urge to buy a new pc to be used for his gaming needs. He has decided that this time he would make his own pc hands on as it is cheaper and also provides him with a sense of pride of he were to complete its construction. Since this is the first time he will be constructing his own pc, the first thing he does is to research on the internet. He then comes across this website, the website will showcase the many different pc parts and their uses such as cpu's, gpu's and fans, along with recommended pc's from different brands that are specifically made for gaming or working. With all the easy to access information from this website, he goes on amazon to purchase the pc parts that he put together in the website <br>
After all the parts he ordered had been delivered to him. He now needs to find out how to construct the pc. Luckily for him, the website also happened to have a section with a video and a step by step written out process on how to build one. With the help from this webste, Mark was able to find the recommended that he wants, learn how to build his pc on his own, and can now game and do work with no frame issues or problems. He is also more experienced in computer hardware now, and can use this skill for the future. For example to help out his friends if they need help with making their own pc's, or to be used as future job experience.


**USER STORY 2** <br>
Lizzie recently had her pc broken and is urgently in need of a new one for her working needs. She is also unfortunately on a tight budget and therefore can't spend that much money on a random pc. She also has no prior knowledge on what is useful in a pre-built pc for working pruposes, weather the cpu,gpu or other hardwares are useful when it comes to work related things. Because of this, she looks to the internet in order to find what would suit a working pc the most. She comes across this website. Here she finds a section called 'hardware information' that peeked her interest. Navigating to that section, she finds information on most of the hardwares in a pc and what thier use is. The recommended pc section also showcased pre-built pc's from different brands attuned for both gaming and working. With the information she has aquired from this, she can plan her budget on a pc (By looking at the recommendations) with a suitable price tag which is also configured to working. 
With the help from this website Lizzie was able to find information on the use of all the pc parts condensed and summarised into one page instead of searching what each part is for. Along with that, she was able to get a pc thats fully kitted for work purposes, and with a reasonable price as well.


## Features
The website would feature many useful tools that the user can use in order to navigate their way through the website. <br>

### Existing Features
**\\Dropdown Tab** <br>
There will be a dropdown tab located at the top of their website which would feature:<br>
**Home:** Leads you to the homepage of the website. It will contain the main purpose of the website as well as 4 large boxes the user can click to navigate to the other areas, it will also contain what the websites purpose is.<br>
**HardWare Information:** This section is all about the summarized information about the different computer parts and what they are useful for. <br>
**Recommendations** This is where the users will be able to mix and match a select amount of pc parts in order to create a pc that they are satisfied with <br>
**How to build!:** This section will contain the step by step process on how to build their pc as well as a video on it. <br>
**Feedback:** This is where users can feedback and comment on the website to request new features or improvements for it. <br>


### Features left to implement
In the future: <br>
I want to add the option for users to buy their computer parts on the website itself since in this current version the users have to go to different platforms to search for the parts. <br>


## Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
