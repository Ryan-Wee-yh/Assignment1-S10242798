Hello and welcome to my assignment! My name is Ryan Wee and the website I am completing today will be about Building Pc's

<h2>Purpose</h2>
Now that we are integrating more technology into our lives, many people would require hardware like computers, laptops and other digital devices in order to survive in this changing world. Because of this, I plan on making this website about making and designing pc's. The purpose is due to the fact that many people would want their own pc's since some would not trust the specs of other pre-built pc's by other brands.
The website will showcase everything from the numerous ways user's can choose how to design their pc's, to how to build their own pc's if they already have the parts to do it. (either via a step-by-step walkthrough or by video)

This website will be useful ion many ways to users. Those that want to build their own pc can access this site and easily find the custom specs and stats that they would want on their pc, and after following through the video/steps on building their pc, they will be more prideful of it since they themselves built it. They will also learn skills that they can use in the future like building a pc or having more information on what specs (CPU,GPU etc.) collaborate well with each other.


<h2>Features</h2>
The website would feature many useful tools that the user can use in order to navigate their way through the platform to find, create and troubleshoot with the pc they would like to build.

**The website will have these features:**
1. The website will showcase a homepage with a top tab.
2. The top tab will showcase multiple areas, it will show
