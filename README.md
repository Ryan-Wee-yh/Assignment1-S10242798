Now that we are integrating more technology into our lives, many people would require hardware like computers, laptops and other digital devices in order to survive in this changing world. Because of this, I plan on making this website about making and designing pc's. The purpose is due to the fact that many people would want their own pc's since some would not trust the specs of other pre-built pc's by other brands.

The website will showcase everything from the numerous ways user's can choose how to design their pc's, to how to build their own pc's if they already have the parts to do it (either via a step-by-step walkthrough or by video). This website will be DIY based, so the process would be; Choosing your specs on the pc you would like to build, ordering them by yourself, following the instructions to build it, finishing. There will be no tab where for example you get someone to help you build the computer.



## Design Process
This website will be catered to those that want to build their own pc with the liberty of choosing their own custom specs and stats that they would want on their pc, and after following through the video/steps on building their pc, They will also learn skills that they can use in the future like building a pc or having more information on what specs (CPU,GPU etc.) collaborate well with each other.

**USER STORY 1** <br>
Mark recently had the urge to buy a new pc to be used for his gaming needs. Due to negative experience of pre-built pc's from popular brands. He has decided that this time he would make his own pc with the hardware that he wants. Since this is the first time he will be constructing his own pc, the first thing he does is to research on the internet. He then comes across this website, the website will showcase the many different pc parts such as cpu's, gpu's and fans, along with recommendations on what parts work and cannot work with each other. With all the easy to access information from this website, he goes on amazon to purchase the pc parts that he put together in the website <br>
After all the parts he ordered had been delivered to him. He now needs to find out how to construct the pc. Luckily for him, the website also happened to have a section with a video and a step by step written out process on how to build one. With the help from this webste, Mark was able to find the pc parts and specs that he wants, learn how to build his pc on his own, and can now game and do work with no frame issues or problems. He is also more experienced in computer hardware now, and can use this skill for the future. For example to help out his friends if they need help with making their own pc's, or to be used as future job experience.


**USER STORY 2** <br>
Lizzie recently had her pc broken and is urgently in need of a new one for her working needs. She is also unfortunately on a tight budget and therefore can't buy parts to make her own pc. However, she has no prior knowledge on what is useful in a pre-built working pc, weather the cpu,gpu or other hardwares are useful. Because of this, she looks to the internet in order to find what would suit a working pc the most. She comes across this website, a first hand look and she expects it to not be useful to her. however there is a section called 'hardware information' that peeked her interest. Navigating to that section, she finds information on most of the hardwares in a pc and what thier use is. With the information she has aquired from this, she can plan her budget on what suits a working pc the best, and go to different brands to find one exactly or at least close to what she wanted with a suitable price tag. 

With the help from this website Lizzie was able to find information on the use of all the pc parts condensed and summarised into one page instead of gsearching what each part is for. Along with that, 


## Features
The website would feature many useful tools that the user can use in order to navigate their way through the platform to find, 'make' and troubleshoot with the pc they would like to build.

### Existing Features
