Now that we are integrating more technology into our lives, many people would require hardware like computers, laptops and other digital devices in order to survive in this changing world. Because of this, I plan on making this website about making and designing pc's. The purpose is due to the fact that many people would want their own pc's since some would not trust the specs of other pre-built pc's by other brands.

The website will showcase everything from the numerous ways user's can choose how to design their pc's, to how to build their own pc's if they already have the parts to do it (either via a step-by-step walkthrough or by video). This website will be DIY based, so the process would be; Choosing your specs on the pc you would like to build, ordering them by yourself, following the instructions to build it, finishing. There will be no tab where for example you get someone to help you build the computer.



## Design Process
This website will be catered to those that want to build their own pc with the liberty of choosing their own custom specs and stats that they would want on their pc, and after following through the video/steps on building their pc, They will also learn skills that they can use in the future like building a pc or having more information on what specs (CPU,GPU etc.) collaborate well with each other.

Mark recently had the urge to buy a new pc to be used for his gaming needs. Due to negative experience of pre-built pc's from popular brands. He has decided that 


## Features
