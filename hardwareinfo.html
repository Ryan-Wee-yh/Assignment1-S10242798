            and output results. It manages the processing of data, which is basically how fast your computer will perform.

            <h1>GPU</h1>

            video editing, and mostly on gaming purposes(Good grphics and such). If you want a gaming pc fit to handle the most 
            powerful games at high graphics, then you need a good GPU!

            <h1>Memory</h1>
            The memory is the holding place for data a computer needs to reach quickly. It's where information is stored for immediate use.
